# PageViewControllerKit

PageViewControllerKit is just a simple wrapper that puts all the boiler plate code associated with the UIPageViewController in the right place. It also provides a feature (Beta) which enables each child
of the pageViewController to know how much of its view has been presented (When it is being presented) and how much its view has been dismissed (When it is being dismissed).
For the time being i don't actively maintain this rep but from time to time i will contribute in order to bring that extra feature to a more stable stable.

There is an example available where you can check how it works until i upload a more appropriate description.
